# 1: Introduction 


### **1.1 Overview**

Our product is an Android app to aid primary school children in completing
their language homework. It will be designed to take text input in a language
and intelligently generate exercises based on this. In this functional
specification we have used Irish as the example language. The final product
will be generic and could easily be used for other languages.
Children will have a clearer understanding of exactly
what is expected of them after their first attempt at each exercise.

Teachers, kids and parents have requested product such as this to help
primary schools nation wide.
The product will have all the different categories of exercises such as

* Word searches

* Fill the blanks

* Storytelling for relevant chapters and exercises

* Spellings

The app will assist kids in coming up with the correct answers by giving
clearer understanding of exercises through audio pronunciations, phonetics,
translation to English and visuals.

### **1.2 Business Context**


This app will be used by primary school children, their parents and teachers

### **1.3 Glossary of Terms**


* SQLite:

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained,
serverless,zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine.

* Android:
An open source operating system for smartphones and tablets.

* SDK:
Software developer kit is a set of tools that allow the creation of
applications for a specific software framework, in our case Android.

* Android Studio:
The official integrated development environment for developing Android
applications.

* GUI:
Graphical User Interface, allows communication between users and the
application through graphics.

# 2. General Description


### **2.1 Product/System Functions**


The app will function as follows:

* **Selections**

	* Main section (books)

*  **Extras**

	* External links

	* Feedback



* **Select type of exercise to be completed**

	* Word Search

### **2.2 User Characteristics and Objectives**


The targeted audience for the app are primary school kids, teachers and
parents and users will need internet access and portable devices such as 
mobile phones and tablets to be able to utilise the application.

The application will be user friendly because human computer interaction
principles are part of the guidelines in the development process. Navigation
will be very easy considering that our targeted audience includes kids.

### **2.4 Constraints**


* **Android OS Version**

We need to design to target Android versions 4.2 upwards. This means our app
will be compatible with almost 90% of devices currently in use(as of November
7th 2016.).

* **RAM**

We will aim for our app to be optimised on devices with 2GB and upwards

* **Screen Size**

We will implement scalability in our app so it will run on as many screen
sizes as possible i.e. from phones to tablets

* **ROM**

We intend to store our data locally. This means we have to consider how
much storage the user has free on their device

*  **Internet Connection**

As we will be using data from abair.ie for our audio the app will require an
internet connection in order for the user to use this feature

* **Battery Life:**

Efficiency of data transmission must be ensured for batteries to last longer

# 3. Functional Requirements
#### **Download**

* Description:

This is where it all starts, during download users will get to know all the
system requirement specifications of the application and see if their device
qualifies or not. It is during this time that users also get to read the
description of the application

*  Criticality:

The app cannot be used without first downloading it and while downloading you
get all the necessary information about the app.

*  Technical Issues:

Internet connectivity is essential for this phase to be completed. It is also
necessary to make sure that the device in use is not in Airplane Mode and the
system requirements must be met otherwise the download would fail.

*  Dependencies:

N/A

#### **Pronunciations**

• Description

The app should be able to provide the user with audio pronunciations for any
Irish word they choose within the app.

• Criticality

This feature is essential for students using the app. Without this feature
they would be left to work out the correct pronunciation on their own which
could prove difficult.

• Technical Issues

We will be using audio from an external source(abair.ie) so we will have to
ensure the user has an internet connection to make use of this feature.

• Dependencies

N/A

#### **Feedback**

• Description

Users of the app should be able to give feedback about it. This could be a
review on the Play Store or an email to the developers e.g. a bug report

• Criticality

The app could function without this feature so it is nonessential. However
we feel it would be beneficial if we implemented it.

• Technical Issues

We will have to make sure the app has the correct permissions to access the
email functions of the phone

• Dependencies

#### **External resources**

• Description

The app will feature a section that contains links to external resources
associated with the chosen language e.g. videos, links to lessons for adults

• Criticality

This is not a critical feature of the app. However we feel the addition of
these resources would be useful for adults using the app.

• Technical Issues

As the links will not be under our control we will have to find resources
that are unlikely to change or be taken down

• Dependencies

N/A

#### **Translation**

• Description

The app should have the ability to translate words from Irish to English.
Users should easily be able to switch words between the 2 languages.

• Criticality

This is a critical feature of our app. It is a key feature for both children
and parents using the app, particularly those with little to no Irish

• Technical Issues

We will need a database of the translations and the translation will have to
be correct

• Dependencies

The translation feature relies on the text being implemented correctly in
the Bun go Barr/Ceartlitriu sections

#### **Choose Book Type**

• Description:

After download the user is presented with the home screen which has three
categories to choose from, two of which belong to the Book Type category namely
Bun go barr and Ceartlitriu. Users chooses their preferred book for homework
completion

• Criticality:

It is very important that users choose the correct book as the tasks / homework
differ in each book.

• Technical Issues:

N/A

• Dependencies:

This requirement is dependent on whether or not the application was successfully
downloaded.

#### **Homework - Word Search**

• Description:

This is a category of homework in both books (Bun go barr and Ceartlitriu), upon
clicking on this category a grid is drawn, words to be searched for are listed
and user is required to click on the letters in the grid to match the relevant words
they are suppose to search for.

• Criticality:

This function is essential as it is part of the academic homework structure of
primary school Irish homework

• Technical Issues:

Internet connectivity is essential as the audio and pronunciations data is from
an external source

• Dependencies:

Relevant book type must first be selected.

#### **Homework - Fill the Blanks**

• Description:

In this category there are sentences with blanks to be filled out, user fills
out the blanks by selecting the correct word from a list of words.

• Criticality:

It is essential in the sense that it is a category of homework

• Technical Issues:

Internet connectivity is essential as the audio and pronunciations data is from
an external source

• Dependencies:

Relevant book type must first be selected.

#### **Homework -Story**

• Description:

Stories section of either of the books can be found here. This serves as a form
of tutorials section to render help before completion of homework.

• Criticality:

This is not essential as the kids must have first read the story in the hard
copy version or teacher must have narrated the story in class

• Technical Issues:

N/A

• Dependencies:

Relevant book type must first be selected.

#### **Homework - Spellings**

• Description:

There is a list of words, each word has been spelt in the wrong order and needs
to be rearranged in the right order.

• Criticality:

This part is essential due to the fact that it is an exercise to be completed.

• Technical Issues:

N/A

• Dependencies:

Relevant book type must first be selected.
