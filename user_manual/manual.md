# 1. **Introduction**

Languages made simple is an Android App originally meant to be Irish Made Simple,designed to help primary school children to understand and complete their Irish homework and where applicable their non-Irish speaking parents can assist their children to complete their homework via the App.  The name of this App was changed when we decided to make more intelligent and flexible. The App is very easy to use and navigation during use is also very basic to meet the level of our targeted users. This App meets Nielson&#39;s principles and has been tested for correctness and robustness. The app extracts verbs from sentences to create "fill in the blank" style exercises which can be completed within the application. These can be created from text files the user has on  their phone or through typing the input manually. This flexible approach means it is not limited to just Irish as our original functional spec proposed. Based on feedback we received on the proposal we improved the intelligence of the app so it was no longer a digital version of
a primary school text book. The pattern matching used means it can also be reused for prepositions. The app has been tested with Irish and the Ghanaian language Ga. The app could be especially useful for endangered languages which don't have a lot tools specifically to cater for them.
